# CE 631: Subject Project Requirements 

Subject project is a group work project (Maximum 3 students per group). Each group has to select a project or problem in your field and collect real-world data from the field about this method or problem, then simulate this method using a developed model for EzStrobe and/or  AnyLogic  to discuss  the  simulation  results  and  analyze  the  intended process  or  problem.  

The  collected  data  have  to  cover  all  the  factors  that  affect  productivity for equipment, if applicable: 
    - cycle time elements and their stochastic duration; 
    - work steps in addition to the required resources, their expenses, and duration for each step. 

The subject  project report has to cover a literature review, equipment and method description using photos or any other means, factors that affect productivity,  data  collection  procedure,  estimation  of  equipment  production,  results,  analysis,  conclusions, references, and appendices that include the real collected raw data.
