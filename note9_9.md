# Lecture 2
## 
1. Types of simulation models : Static vs. Dynamic, Deterministic vs. stastics, Discrete vs. Continous(uniform / uneven time step).
2. Types of simulation languages
   - General puroise / special purpose / generic programming languages
   - WebCYCLONE,STROBOSCOPE,EzStrobe,ANYLOGIC
3. Process planning : cyclic claims PERT type network.
4. validation(every step) and verification(final result).
5. Work tasks, Resource Units(labor, equipment, materials, space), Resource Unit flow routes(used to measure productivity or lack of productivity, active or idle) 

## Cyclone (Cyclic Operation Network)
1. normal square activity with one resource , more than one resources(square thit a corner line Combination, only queue can before it)
2. queue idle can not before ACCUMULATOR
3. Entity move through
