# Lecture 1 - 4 Quiz Questions
1. Define simulation. Why is simulation important in construction?
   - simulation: Building a mathematical-logical model of a system and experimenting with it on a computer. The ideal objective of computer simulation is to OPTIMIZE system Performance
    > A simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time. Whether done by hand or on a computer, simulation  involves  the generation of an artificial history of a system and the obserÂ­ vation of that artificial history to draw inferences concerning the operating characteristics of the real system. (P-2 Discrete-Event)
   - Study new designs without interrupting real system / the need for extra resources. 
   - Improve understanding of system. 
   - Manipulate time.
   - Less dangerous / expensive / intrusive.
    > The advantages to be achieved focus on the simplicity of a paper and pencil modeling that is inexpensive to construct and may provide insights into system syra. Thest would be extremely expensive to gain by observations onto e actual system. These insights often may be gained only after costly mistakes and expensive production runs have been made with the real-world system.(P-172)

2. What are the different simulation packages available for construction?
   - WebCYCLONE,STROBOSCOPE,EzStrobe,ANYLOGIC
3. List different types of models.
   - Static model: site layout diagram.
   - Dynamic model: action of a pile driving hammer.
   - Deterministic model: all times are constants.
   - Stochastic model: all times are random (variable).
   - Discrete event model: time advances in uneven steps.
   - Continuous event model: time advances in uniform steps.
4. What are the MicroCYCLONE elements for graphical representation? List their functions.
   - NORMAL
   - COMBInation
   - QUEue
   - COUNTER
   - ARC
5. Model earth moving simulation using MicroCYCLONE.

6. Model the construction of a new faculty in the Z Block bridge using MicroCYCLONE.
   - 
7. Model a construction operation (i.e. trenchless techniques, tunneling, slip forming, bridge construction, piling, platforms, etc) using MicroCYCLONE.
   - 
8. Explain the major simulation concepts. 
   - Simulation is a preplanning technique which can be used to preplan any cyclic construction operation before construction begins or at the beginning of the operation.
