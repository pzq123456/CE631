## Subject Project Requirements 
 
Subject project is a group work project (Maximum 3 students per group). Each group has to select a project or problem in your field and collect real-world data from the field about this method or problem, then simulate this method using a developed model for EzStrobe and/or  AnyLogic  to discuss  the  simulation  results  and  analyze  the  intended process  or  problem.  The  collected  data  have  to  cover  all  the  factors  that  affect  productivity for equipment, if applicable: cycle time elements and their stochastic duration; work steps in addition to the required resources, their expenses, and duration for each step. The subject  project report has to cover a literature review, equipment and method description using photos or any other means, factors that affect productivity,  data  collection  procedure,  estimation  of  equipment  production,  results,  analysis, conclusions, references, and appendices that include the real collected raw data. 
 
### Some guidelines for this project: 
1. Each group is going to submit one final report on Monday - 2024/11/18, before 8:00am to a drop box drive or any other means that will be provided on time. This report includes: 
    a. A cover page that includes group names, project process name, class project title, suggested executer name and logo, etc. 
    b. A  cover  letter  to  the  executer’s  technical  office  showing  that  you  did  study  the  
    intended process. You are acting as a part of the technical office team  submitting a progress report to your boss about the selected process. 
    c. Spread sheets that show all calculations and associated sketches, if necessary. 
    d. Equipment(s) description, details, and sketches from literature and companies. 
    e. Explanation of data collection method about this construction process to 
    calculate productivity. 
    f. Simulation procedures and features using both programs. 
    g. Productivity and cost estimation and analysis. 
    h. Results and conclusions. 
    i. References. 
    j. Appendix: includes  all  the  items  that  you  could  not  cover  in  the  report  where they need extra explanations. 
    
2. **A  midterm  progress  report  on  the  subject  project  should  be  submitted  in  class  on  September 30, 2024.** This report includes the progress that is completed by the group in the  project  until  the  submission  date.  The  progress  report  will  cover,  at  least,  the  following: introduction, literature review, equipment and steps description using photos or any other means, factors that affect productivity, and data collection  procedure of the selected project. The format of this progress report follows the above items from a to j in point 1. 
3. Each  group  has  to  present  what  they  did  in  the  project  on  2024/11/18  in  class.  There  are three tasks for each group to present: literature review and construction process, data collection  procedure  and  simulation  procedure,  and  productivity  analysis.  Each  group  member has to present one task. 
4. A peer-evaluation form will be posted on our website for each group member to evaluate his/her partners’ performance in the project. It should be submitted to the instructor on 2024/11/18. 
5. Each  student  will  be  evaluated  according  to  project  report,  presentation,  and  peerevaluation.  If a  group  selects  one  presenter,  each  individual  inside  this  group  is  going to have same grade as the presenter in the presentation part.
