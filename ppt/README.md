# 讲稿 | Wildfire Modelling Simulation in Wildland-Urban-Interface
## 1. Background & Literature Review

With the global climate change, Wildfire is becoming a more and more serious problem. We hope to simulate the spread of Wildfire in order to better predict the spread of Wildfire, so as to better cope with Wildfire.Wildfire behavior is a complex and dynamic phenomenon influenced by various factors. As such, fire spread is not always linear or steady-state, and predicting its course can be challenging. 

Real-time fire spread forecasts can aid fire services in allocating  resources,  planning  evacuations,  and  implementing  other  emergency  response measures by predicting a fire's expected trajectory and intensity. These predictions can also assist residents in making informed decisions about their safety and help to prevent loss of life and property damage.

我们可以看到，对于火焰传播模拟的研究大约经过了五个阶段，我们正处在第五个。第一个阶段是基于人的观察和经验总结，第二个阶段是基于统计分析的，第三个阶段是基于物理模型的，第四个阶段是基于数值模拟的，第五个阶段是基于机器学习的。我们希望通过机器学习的方法来模拟火灾的传播，以便更好地预测火灾的传播，从而更好地应对火灾。

We can see that the research on fire spread simulation has gone through about five stages, and we are in the fifth stage. The first stage is based on human observation and experience summary, the second stage is based on statistical analysis, the third stage is based on physical models, the fourth stage is based on numerical simulation, and the fifth stage is based on machine learning. We hope to simulate the spread of fire through machine learning methods in order to better predict the spread of fire and better cope with fire.

## 2. Real World Data
We downloaded the wind direction, wind speed and humidity data from the Hong Kong Government data open platform for the past twenty years. By analyzing these accumulated data, we can obtain the statistical distribution of some key meteorological characteristics of the study area, so as to carry out Monte Carlo simulation based on this in the future.
